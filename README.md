# Splitting

_CSS Vars for split words and chars!_

Splitting is a JavaScript microlibrary (less than 1kb) to split a DOM element's words and characters into elements. The word and character elements are populated with CSS vars to assist with CSS transitions and animations that were previously not feasible with CSS.
